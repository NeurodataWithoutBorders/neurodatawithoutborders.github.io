  content: To guide the next phase of growth, and to coordinate the various
    efforts, NWB has created a governance structure. This will allow NWB to grow
    in a bottom-up, but coordinated manner. Participation in the project is open
    to any interested neuroscientist, with overall planning coordinated by an
    Executive Board (EB) and overall technical development coordinated by a
    Technical Advisory Board (TAB).
