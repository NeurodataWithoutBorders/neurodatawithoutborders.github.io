## Welcome to the DANDI+NWB Tutorial at COSYNE 2023!

The [Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)](https://www.nwb.org/) team is holding a tutorial on the [DANDI Archive](https://www.dandiarchive.org/) and NWB data standard and on using [PyNWB](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [MatNWB](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/matnwb) at the COSYNE 2023 tutorial session.

The DANDI Archive now has 100+ publicly available neurophysiology datasets stored using the NWB data standard.

The NWB project is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy-barrier to applying data analytics both within and across labs. NWB is more than just a file format but it defines an [ecosystem](https://nwb-overview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/tools_home.html) of tools, methods, and standards for storing, sharing, and analyzing complex neurophysiology data.

## What You'll Learn

At this tutorial, we'll teach you how to:

- Find relevant data on the DANDI Archive and use the DANDI compute resources 
- Stream NWB data from DANDI and read an NWB file in Python and MATLAB
- Process NWB data using popular tools such as SpikeInterface and suite2p
- Analyze NWB data using tools such as Pynapple, SSM, or your own scripts

Bring your laptop to work along with the demonstration. To get familiar with NWB and DANDI prior to attending, please refer to this [documentation](https://nwb-overview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Tutorial Program

- **8:00 - 8:30**: Introduction to the NWB data standard and DANDI Archive
- **8:30 - 8:55**: How to find relevant data on the DANDI archive and use the DANDI Hub
- **8:55 - 9:00**: Break
- **9:00 - 9:20**: How to read and explore an NWB file in Python and MATLAB
- **9:20 - 9:50**: How to analyze NWB data using popular data processing and visualization tools
  - Using [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface#spikeinterface-a-unified-framework-for-spike-sorting) to sort raw extracellular electrophysiology recording data streamed from DANDI & write the output back to NWB
  - Storing [DeepLabCut](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) and [SLEAP](https://sleap.ai/) pose estimation data in NWB
  - Using calcium imaging analysis tools, such as [CaImAn](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn#caiman) and [suite2p](https://www.suite2p.org/) to process and segment raw imaging data and write the output to NWB
