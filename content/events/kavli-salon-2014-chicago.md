## Overview

The Kavli Salon: Neurodata Without Borders 1 was one of the earliest organized discussions about the need for standardized neuroscience data formats. This event helped set the stage for what would later become the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) initiative.

## Objective

The objective of this salon was to bring together neuroscientists and data scientists to discuss the challenges of sharing and analyzing neurophysiology data across different laboratories and experimental paradigms. This meeting was instrumental in identifying the need for a standardized data format that would later evolve into the NWB data standard.
