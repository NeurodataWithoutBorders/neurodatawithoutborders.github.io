# Open Neurodata Showcase 2024
## *Meet the scientists who have publicly shared neurophysiology data*

[The DANDI Archive](http://dandiarchive.org) now has 199+ neurophysiology datasets in the [Neurodata Without Borders](http://nwb.org) format spanning many species, brain areas, task types, and imaging modalities. These include high-value datasets, e.g. from [Allen Institute OpenScope](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/search?search=openscope), the [MICrONS project](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000402), and the [International Brain Laboratory Brain Wide Map](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000409), as well as diverse contributions from neuroscience labs around the world.

In this event, we organize a virtual poster session in the Gather platform to bring together data contributors and anyone interested in reusing existing neurophysiology data. This virtual event offers a unique opportunity for participants to engage in discussions, explore dandisets, and allows data contributors to showcase their projects.

## Dates and Location

- **Date:** July 2, 2024, 9:00 - 10:30 AM PDT (UTC-7)
- **Location:** Virtual in Gather (link to be shared closer to the event date)

## Eligibility

This virtual event is open to anyone interested in neurophysiology data, including but not limited to:
* Neuroscience graduate students, post-docs, and other researchers interested in using open data in their research
* Educators who want to use real datasets in their lessons
* Undergraduates and high school students interested in learning about neuroscience
* Open science advocates
