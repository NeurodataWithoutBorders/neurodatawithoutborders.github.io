## Dates and Location

- **Dates:** October 3-5, 2022
- **Location:** [The Allen Institute](https://alleninstitute.org/) - 615 Westlake Ave N, Seattle, WA USA 98109

## Objective

The DANDI Archive now has 89+ neurophysiology datasets in the NWB format spanning many different species, brain areas, task types, and imaging modalities. It is now time for us to shift our focus to reanalyzing these datasets.

In this workshop, we taught attendees about the open neurophysiology datasets available on the DANDI Archive and trained them on how to maximally utilize the archive and the NWB standard to incorporate existing data into their scientific workflows. This was the first event of its type for NWB, so the team also learned about how to facilitate data reuse in the neuroscience community.
