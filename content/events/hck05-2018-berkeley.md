## Objective

The Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology project (NWB:N, www.nwb.org) is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB:N enables data sharing/reuse and reduces the energy-barrier to applying data analytics both within and across labs. Several laboratories, including the Allen Institute for Brain Science, have wholeheartedly adopted NWB:N. The community needs to join forces to achieve data standardization in neurophysiology.

This hackathon event invited experts from the neuroscience community to explore adopting NWB:N for their data sharing needs and lab use cases. The goal of this event was to:
- Train new users on NWB:N
- Promote adoption of NWB:N
- Work with users on programming projects, e.g, to integrate examples of their labs data into NWB:N
- Facilitate communication between users and developers and project teams
- Engage with the community
