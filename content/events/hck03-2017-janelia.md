## Overview

A small group of active users and programmers of the NWB:Neurophysiology data format representing a broad and deep range of interests and expertise gathered to discuss future development for the format and API. This small gathering was held at HHMI Janelia Research Campus near Washington, DC's Dulles Airport beginning at 9 am on Monday, July 31 and concluding at 4 pm on Tuesday, August 1, 2017.

Since this was an active and interactive exchange of ideas and code, participants were asked to bring sample datasets and relevant documentation to the meeting so that issues could be raised and addressed in real-time.

## Objective

As part of the development of NWB 2.0, this hackathon was one of the core NWB hackathons that focused on the development of the NWB data standard and software. The primary focus was on the development of the NWB format as well as on the development of a software strategy for NWB.

The Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology project (NWB:N) is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB:N enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy-barrier to applying data analysis both within and across labs.
