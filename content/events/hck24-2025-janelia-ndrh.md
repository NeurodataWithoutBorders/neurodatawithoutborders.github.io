## Objective

[The DANDI Archive](http://dandiarchive.org) now has 300+ neurophysiology datasets in the 
[Neurodata Without Borders](http://nwb.org) format spanning many species, brain areas, task types, and imaging 
modalities. These include high-value datasets, e.g. from [Allen Institute OpenScope](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/search?search=openscope), the [MICrONS project](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000402), and the 
[International Brain Laboratory Brain Wide Map](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000409), as well as diverse contributions from neuroscience labs around the world. In this 
workshop, we will teach attendees about the open neurophysiology datasets available on the DANDI Archive and train 
them on how to maximally utilize the archive and the NWB standard to incorporate existing data into their scientific 
workflows. Feedback from attendees will be used to improve the software and data standard to better enable 
reanalysis workflows.

Example projects include but are not limited to:
* Determine whether your result is present in another species or brain area.
* Showcase the capabilities of your tool or analysis on existing data from another lab.
* Explore follow-up questions to a study.
* Create educational content that uses open data.

This event will primarily focus on analyzing existing data in NWB and on DANDI, **not** converting data to NWB. If 
you are interested in learning how to convert data, consider signing up for an NWB Data Conversion Workshop.

## Kavli Neurodata Discovery Award

Following the event, participants will be invited to apply for a Kavli Foundation Neurodata Discovery Awards, which awards $50,000 (USD) of funding to continue data reanalysis projects that come out of the NeuroDataReHack event. This is a funding opportunity exclusive to NeuroDataReHack participants.

## Testimonials from NeuroDataReHack 2024

> "This workshop was enlightening, and I'm excited to bring these tools back to my research group and my university!"
>
> — Miles Martinez, Duke University

> "The Hackathon was an incredible experience. I had the opportunity to get familiar with not only NWB but also the expanding NWB ecosystem. Additionally, the week was fantastic for connecting with others working on similar topics. I established potential collaborations and learned from people working on different topics as well."
>
> — Carolina Filipe, Champalimaud Foundation

> "NeuroDataReHack 2024 is a inspiring tour to the ecosystem that the NWB and DANDI has supported, including a set of useful tools, datasets, and example notebook to hand on. Great opportunities to meet the organizers that make those things happen, and to connect with other researchers interested in dataset reuse."
