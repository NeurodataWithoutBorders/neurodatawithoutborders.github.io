# NWB Data Conversion Workshop 2024

The [Neurodata Without Borders](https://nwb.org) project is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to applying data analytics both within and across labs. NWB has seen wide adoption in the neurophysiology community, and there are now over 100 datasets on the DANDI Archive in NWB, including data from the Allen Institute and the International Brain Laboratory.

The NWB Data Conversion Workshop trained members of the neuroscience community on how to convert their data to NWB and publish it on the DANDI Archive. We trained attendees starting from the basics of the NWB format and proceeding to domain-specific tutorials and advanced data engineering techniques to maximally utilize the features of the HDF5 and Zarr backends. During this workshop, we introduced multiple sets of tools with varying levels of flexibility for converting data, including NWB GUIDE, a new no-code user interface for data conversion.

**Note:** All levels of experience were welcome! We had tutorials ranging from no-code, automated data conversion to more advanced, custom code conversion.

## What to Bring

* Example datasets you would like to convert. For lab-specific data (i.e., data not in these [supported formats](https://nwb-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format_support.html)), you should ideally have scripts for reading the data using Python or MATLAB.
* Your laptop with appropriate software installed. For installation instructions see:
  * [**NWB GUIDE**](https://nwb-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
  * [**PyNWB (Python)**](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install_users.html)
  * [**MatNWB (Matlab)**](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/matnwb/)
* For an overview of NWB software, see also: 
  * [**Glossary of Core NWB Tools**](https://nwb-overview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core_tools/core_tools_home.html)
