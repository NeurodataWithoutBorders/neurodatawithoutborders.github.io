## Dates and Location

- **Dates:** July 25-27, 2022
- **Location:** [HHMI Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org/), 19700 Helix Dr, Ashburn, VA 20147, [Directions](https://www.janelia.org/directions)

## Objective

The Neurodata Without Borders project (NWB, nwb.org) is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy-barrier to applying data analytics both within and across labs. Several laboratories, including the Allen Institute for Brain Science, have wholeheartedly adopted NWB. The community needs to join forces to achieve data standardization in neurophysiology.

The purpose of the hackathon was to bring the experimental neurophysiology community together to further adoption and the development of NWB, the NWB software libraries, and the progress of the scientific workflows that rely on NWB. Members of the community exchanged ideas and best practices for using NWB and the libraries, shared NWB based tools, surfaced common needs, solved bugs, made feature requests, brainstormed about future funding and collaboration, and made progress on current blockages. The event also enabled NWB developers and users to interact with each other to facilitate communication, gather requirements, and train users.

Note: This event was meant to foster community and collaboration around NWB, not competition. As such, this was really more of a "workshop" or "tutorial" than a "hackathon." There were no judges nor prizes. Participants were expected to bring data from their own lab and/or collaborate with others to build integration with NWB.

## Tutorial Materials

* [BEADL Tutorial](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb_hackathons/tree/master/HCK13_2022_Janelia/projects/beadl_tutorial)
* [NeuroConv Tutorial](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb_hackathons/tree/master/HCK13_2022_Janelia/projects/neuroconv_tutorial)

## Resources

### Talks
Recordings of talks were made available on the [NWB Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfD_mU-EFz135a9TpNFJP5A).

## What to bring?

* Create the outline for your project at the hackathon.
* Bring any example data sets needed for your project with you to the hackathon. For any lab-specific data (i.e., data not in NWB) you should know how to read the data using Python or MATLAB and ideally have scripts ready for reading the data.
* Bring your laptop with appropriate software installed. For instructions on how to install PyNWB see [https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install_users.html](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install_users.html)
