## Objective

[The DANDI Archive](http://dandiarchive.org) now has 450+ neurophysiology datasets in the 
[Neurodata Without Borders](http://nwb.org) format spanning many species, brain areas, task types, and imaging 
modalities. These include high-value datasets, e.g. from [Allen Institute OpenScope](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/search?search=openscope), the [MICrONS project](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000402), and the 
[International Brain Laboratory Brain Wide Map](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000409), as well as diverse contributions from neuroscience labs around the world. In this 
workshop, we will teach attendees about the open neurophysiology datasets available on the DANDI Archive and train 
them on how to maximally utilize the archive and the NWB standard to incorporate existing data into their scientific 
workflows. Feedback from attendees will be used to improve the software and data standard to better enable 
reanalysis workflows.

Example projects include but are not limited to:
* Determine whether your result is present in another species or brain area.
* Showcase the capabilities of your tool or analysis on existing data from another lab.
* Explore follow-up questions to a study.
* Create educational content that uses open data.

This event will primarily focus on analyzing existing data in NWB and on DANDI, **not** converting data to NWB. If 
you are interested in learning how to convert data, consider signing up for an NWB Data Conversion Workshop.

## Application

**Applications are now open!**

Apply to participate in NeuroDataReHack 2026 by completing the application form:

**[Apply Here](https://forms.gle/6uird2uknZeJbmPr7)**

Space is limited, so we encourage you to apply early. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

Applications close February 20, 2026.

## Schedule

Schedule details will be posted closer to the event date.

<!-- ## Kavli Neurodata Discovery Award

Following the event, participants will be invited to apply for a Kavli Foundation Neurodata Discovery Awards, which awards $50,000 (USD) of funding to continue data reanalysis projects that come out of the NeuroDataReHack event. This is a funding opportunity exclusive to NeuroDataReHack participants.

## Eligibility

Eligibility is broad. This course is intended for PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, principal investigators, or similar.
Advanced undergraduates may be considered on a case-by-case basis. We welcome applicants from all areas of
neuroscience, including but not limited to experimentalists, computational neuroscientists, and data scientists.
Applicants should have basic programming experience in Python or MATLAB and experience with neurophysiology research.
Preference will be given to applicants who have a specific project in mind that involves reanalyzing existing
neurophysiology data in NWB format and who has not previously attended a NeuroDataReHack event.

## Logistics

Thanks to the generous sponsorship of The Janelia Research Campus, this event will be free to participants:
* There is no registration or application fee.
* Participants will be provided a private room at Janelia Research Campus for the duration of this event, 
  checking in on Sunday, July 12, and checking out the evening of Friday, July 17 or the morning of Saturday, July 18.
* Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and coffee breaks will be provided. Janelia is adept at accommodating dietary 
  restrictions; please indicate any dietary restrictions on your application.
* You will be responsible for booking your own flight and transportation to Janelia Research Campus.
* You will be responsible for determining visa and/or healthcare requirements for travel to the United States. Please 
  plan accordingly, as this process can take several months. We would be happy to provide a letter of invitation to
  support your visa application if needed.

## What to Bring

Bring a laptop with appropriate software installed. Python should be installed and MATLAB is optional. For 
instructions on how to install PyNWB, see 
[the PyNWB documentation](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install_users.html#installing-pynwb). For instructions
on how to install MatNWB, see
