## Dates and Location

- **Dates:** September 22-23, 2022
- **Location:** Virtual (Anywhere with an internet connection)

## Overview

The workshop focused primarily on improving documentation and tutorials for the NWB APIs, schema, and community tools that use NWB.

## Objective

The Neurodata Without Borders project (NWB, [https://www.nwb.org/](https://www.nwb.org/)) is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to applying data analysis both within and across labs. Several laboratories, including the Allen Institute for Brain Science, have wholeheartedly adopted NWB. The community needs to join forces to achieve data standardization in neurophysiology.

The purpose of the NWB Docathon was to bring users and developers of the experimental neurophysiology community together to improve documentation and tutorials for the NWB APIs, schema, and community tools that use NWB.

## How to prepare?
