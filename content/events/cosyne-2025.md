# NWB & DANDI Tutorial at COSYNE 2025

The [Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)](https://www.nwb.org/) team is holding a tutorial on the NWB data standard and [DANDI Archive](https://www.dandiarchive.org/) during the [tutorial session of COSYNE 2025](https://www.cosyne.org/tutorials).

The goal of this tutorial is to teach you how to share your neurophysiology data using the [Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)](https://www.nwb.org/) data standard and the [DANDI Archive](https://www.dandiarchive.org/) and how to use NWB data available on DANDI. NWB standardizes the storage of neurophysiology data and metadata to facilitate data analysis, sharing, and reuse. The DANDI Archive now has 300+ TB of neurophysiology data across 300+ publicly available datasets in NWB, including from the Allen Institute, International Brain Laboratory, MICRONS project, and over 150 individual labs. In this tutorial, we will introduce several new tools to convert data to NWB, publish data to DANDI, and stream data from DANDI. We will also introduce new community tools for data analysis and management that are integrated with NWB, so this tutorial will be useful for both new and returning attendees.

## What You'll Learn

At this tutorial, we will teach you how to:
- Convert neurophysiology data to NWB and publish it on DANDI using the new [NWB GUIDE app](https://nwb-guide.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and other tools
- Read local NWB data using Python and MATLAB, and efficiently stream remote NWB data on DANDI using the new LINDI tool
- Process, analyze, and manage NWB data using popular community tools, including tools that have not previously presented as part of this tutorial

Bring your laptop to work along with the demonstration. To get familiar with NWB and DANDI prior to attending, please refer to this [documentation](https://nwb-overview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
