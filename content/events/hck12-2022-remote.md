## Overview

Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) and the DANDI neurophysiology data archive development teams joined together to create a remote hackathon event for developers. In contrast to the User Days hackathons that focus on training users, this event focused on bringing together the developers of the NWB data standard, the DANDI development team, and developers of tools in the NWB ecosystem.

This hackathon enabled participants to work intensively on an NWB or DANDI-related project with the assistance of core developers and others in the community. Participants shared updates with each other on NWB, DANDI, and related community projects. Together, they developed and discussed ideas for solving technical problems that impact the broader community. The goal was to foster collaboration and community among developers working on and with NWB and DANDI.

## Objective

The Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology project (NWB, [https://www.nwb.org/](https://www.nwb.org/)) is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to applying data analysis both within and across labs. Several laboratories, including the Allen Institute for Brain Science, have wholeheartedly adopted NWB. The community needs to join forces to achieve data standardization in neurophysiology.

The Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration (DANDI, [https://www.dandiarchive.org/](https://www.dandiarchive.org/)) is a platform for publishing, sharing, and processing neurophysiology data funded by the BRAIN Initiative. The platform is now available for data upload and distribution.

The purpose of the NWB+DANDI Developer Hackathon was to bring the neurophysiology developer community together to further the development NWB and DANDI and integration of NWB and DANDI with tools. Members of the community worked jointly on coding projects, exchanged ideas and best practices, surfaced common needs, resolved coding issues, made feature requests, brainstormed about future collaboration, and made progress on current blockages.

## Matchmaking Chat

To facilitate networking and social interactions during the hackathon, there was a session of 2 one-on-one 15-minute chats between participants. This format was adapted from the successful mindmatching from the neuromatch conference.
