# Open Neurodata Showcase 2023
## *Meet the scientists who have publicly shared neurophysiology data*

[The DANDI Archive](http://dandiarchive.org) now has 175+ neurophysiology datasets in the [Neurodata Without Borders](http://nwb.org) format spanning many species, brain areas, task types, and imaging modalities. These include high-value datasets, e.g., from The Allen Institute, the MICrONS project, and the International Brain Laboratory, as well as diverse contributions from neuroscience labs around the world.

In this event, we organized a virtual poster session in the Gather platform to bring together data contributors and anyone interested in reusing existing neurophysiology data. This virtual event offered a unique opportunity for participants to engage in discussions, explore dandisets, and allowed data contributors to showcase their projects.

## Dates and Location

- **Date:** August 28, 2023, 9:00 - 10:30 AM PDT (UTC-7)
- **Location:** Virtual in Gather
