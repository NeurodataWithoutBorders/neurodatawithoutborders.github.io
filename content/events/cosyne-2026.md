# Welcome to the NWB & DANDI Tutorial at COSYNE 2026!

The [Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)](https://www.nwb.org/) team will hold a tutorial on the NWB data standard and [DANDI Archive](https://www.dandiarchive.org/) during the [tutorial session of COSYNE 2026](https://www.cosyne.org/tutorials).

The [NWB](https://www.nwb.org/) project is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to analyzing data both within and across labs. NWB is more than just a file format; it defines an [ecosystem](https://nwb-overview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/analysis_tools_home.html) of tools, methods, and standards for storing, sharing, and analyzing neurophysiology data, including extracellular electrophysiology, intracellular electrophysiology, optical physiology, and behavior.

The [DANDI Archive](https://www.dandiarchive.org/) continues to grow with hundreds of publicly available neurophysiology datasets stored using the NWB data standard, including from the Allen Institute, International Brain Laboratory, MICRONS project, and hundreds of individual labs.

At this tutorial, we will teach attendees how to:

- Convert neurophysiology data to NWB and publish it on the DANDI Archive
- Find relevant data on the DANDI Archive and use the DANDI compute resources
- Read NWB data streamed from DANDI or downloaded locally
- Process and analyze NWB data using popular tools such as SpikeInterface and Pynapple

## Dates and Location

* **Date/Time:** March 12, 2026, Time TBD -- check the [COSYNE 2026 tutorial page](https://www.cosyne.org/tutorials) for updates
* **Location:** Lisbon Conference Centre, Lisbon, Portugal

## Tutorial Program

TDB

<!-- 8:00 - 8:30: Lecture: Introduction to the NWB data standard and DANDI Archive

8:30 - 8:45: Follow along: Convert common neurophysiology data formats to NWB and publish NWB data to DANDI

8:45 - 9:00: Follow along: Use the DANDI Archive and community tools, such as [Neurosift](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/neurosift) and [NWB Widgets](https://nwb-widgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), to find and visualize relevant data

9:00 - 9:30: Follow along: Read NWB data streamed from DANDI and downloaded locally, and analyze NWB data using popular tools, such as:

- [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface#spikeinterface-a-unified-framework-for-spike-sorting) to spike sort raw extracellular electrophysiology recording data streamed from DANDI & write the output back to NWB
- [Pynapple](https://pynapple-org.github.io/pynapple/) to perform common analysis functions on NWB data, such as compute tuning curves and cross-correlograms -->
