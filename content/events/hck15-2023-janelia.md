## What to Bring

* Bring any example data sets needed for your project with you to the hackathon. For any lab-specific data (i.e., 
  data not in NWB), you should know how to read the data using Python or MATLAB and ideally have scripts ready for 
  reading the data.
* Bring your laptop with appropriate software installed. For installation instructions see:
  * [**PyNWB (Python)**](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install_users.html). If you are a developer and want to contribute to PyNWB see the [**Installing PyNWB for Developers**](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install_developers.html) instructions. 
  * [**MatNWB (Matlab)**](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/matnwb/)
* For an overview of NWB software, see also: 
  * [**Glossary of Core NWB Tools**](https://nwb-overview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core_tools/core_tools_home.html) 
  * [**Glossary of Analysis and Visualization Tools**](https://nwb-overview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/tools_home.html)

## Objective

The [Neurodata Without Borders](nwb.org) project is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology
data and metadata. NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to applying data analytics both within
and across labs. NWB has seen wide adoption in the neurophysiology community, and there are now over 100 datasets on the
DANDI Archive in NWB, including data from the Allen Institute and the International Brain Laboratory.

The **User Days** will train users how to convert their data to NWB and publish it on the DANDI Archive. 
We will work with members of the neuroscience community that want to apply NWB to their datasets. We will train 
attendees, starting from the basics and proceeding to advanced data engineering techniques to maximally utilize the
features of the HDF5 and Zarr backends. Attendees will also be trained in the creation of NWB extensions.

The **Developer Days** will bring neuroscientists, tool builders, and research software engineers together to further the
development of the NWB software ecosystem, including the data standard, core software packages, official tools, and community tools. 
Members of the community will exchange ideas and best practices for using NWB and the libraries, share NWB based tools, surface 
common needs, solve bugs, make feature requests, brainstorm about future funding and collaboration, and make progress 
on current blockages.

**Note:** This event is meant to foster community and collaboration around NWB, not competition. As such, this is really
more of a "workshop" or "tutorial" than a "hackathon." There will be no judges nor prizes. Participants will be expected
to bring data from their own lab, bring their own tool, or other relevant project and/or collaborate with others to 
build integration with NWB.
