## Overview

The first Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) hackathon brought together neuroscientists and software developers to discuss the development of a common data format for neurophysiology. This gathering marked the beginning of the NWB initiative, aiming to standardize neuroscience data to enable greater data sharing and collaboration across the field.

## Objective

The primary objective of this inaugural hackathon was to establish the groundwork for developing a standardized neurophysiology data format. Participants discussed challenges in data sharing, examined existing file formats, and began exploring potential solutions that would eventually evolve into the NWB data standard.

## Organizer

- The Kavli Foundation
