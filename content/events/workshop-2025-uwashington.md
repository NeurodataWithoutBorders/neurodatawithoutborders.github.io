# NWB and DANDI Workshop
## Hosted by the University of Washington

Join us for an interactive workshop on [Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)](https://nwb.org), a data standard for neurophysiology, and the [DANDI Archive](https://dandiarchive.org), a collaboration platform for publishing, sharing, and processing neurophysiology data. Learn how to use these resources to maximize the impact of your data while complying with the new NIH data sharing and management policies.

## Target Audience

This workshop is designed for neuroscience researchers at all career stages, from undergraduate students working in labs to graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and principal investigators. No prior programming experience is required.

## Dates and Location

- **Dates:** April 7-8, 2025
- **Location:** South Campus Center (SOCC) 354, University of Washington, Seattle, WA
