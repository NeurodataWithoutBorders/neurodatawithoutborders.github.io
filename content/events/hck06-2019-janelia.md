## Objective

The Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology project (NWB:N, https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/) is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB:N enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy-barrier to applying data analytics both within and across labs. Several laboratories, including the Allen Institute for Brain Science, have wholeheartedly adopted NWB:N. The community needs to join forces to achieve data standardization in neurophysiology.

The purpose of the hackathon was to bring the experimental neurophysiology community together to further adoption and the development of NWB:N, the NWB:N software libraries, and the progress of the scientific workflows that rely on NWB:N. Members of the community exchanged ideas and best practices for using NWB:N and the libraries, shared NWB:N based tools, surfaced common needs, solved bugs, made feature requests, brainstormed about future funding and collaboration, and made progress on current blockages. The event also enabled NWB:N developers and users to interact with each other to facilitate communication, gather requirements, and train users.

The event was planned for 4 days, where the first two days focused on user training and use-cases followed by two days focused on core development. Work involved collaborative, open source software development, with a focus on use cases, tools, and core development.
