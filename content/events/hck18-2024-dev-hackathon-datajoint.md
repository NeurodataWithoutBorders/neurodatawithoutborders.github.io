# 2024 NWB Developer Hackathon hosted by DataJoint

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) team organized a hackathon event for developers. In contrast to NWB user training workshops, this event was focused on bringing together the developers of the NWB data standard and software ecosystem and developers of community tools who would like to integrate their tools with NWB. This hackathon enabled participants to work intensively on an NWB-related project with the assistance of the NWB development team and others in the community.

This was the first NWB hackathon event hosted by DataJoint. Working in the DataJoint building and with their team facilitated projects at the intersection between DataJoint and NWB, such as Spyglass or building NWB export for custom DataJoint pipelines. The event also welcomed NWB projects that were not related to DataJoint.

## Dates and Location

- **Dates:** Wednesday, April 17, 2024, 9 AM to Friday, April 19, 2024, 5:30 PM
- **Location:** DataJoint headquarters, 4265 San Felipe St #1025, Houston, TX 77027

## Objective

The [Neurodata Without Borders](https://www.nwb.org/) project is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to applying data analytics both within and across labs. NWB has seen wide adoption in the neurophysiology community, and there are now over 175 datasets on the DANDI Archive in NWB, including data from the Allen Institute and the International Brain Laboratory.

The NWB Developer Hackathon brought neuroscientists, tool builders, and research software engineers together to further the development of the NWB software ecosystem, including the data standard, core software packages, official tools, and community tools. Members of the community exchanged ideas and best practices for using NWB and the libraries, shared NWB based tools, surfaced common needs, solved bugs, made feature requests, brainstormed about future funding and collaboration, and made progress on current blockages.
