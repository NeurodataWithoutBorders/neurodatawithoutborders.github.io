# Agenda Templates

This page provides example agenda templates for different types of NWB workshops. These templates can be customized to fit your specific event needs.

## NWB \+ DANDI Overview Workshop Template

- **Learning objective:** Attendees will learn about the NWB and DANDI software ecosystem, from data conversion and data publication to data reuse.

- **Estimated duration:** 1 day. The talks can be covered in a half day, and the remaining time can be used for conversion projects, discussion, or 1:1 support.

- **Prerequisites / requirements:** None, this workshop is intended for people new to the NWB ecosystem.

- **Previous examples:** [NWB and DANDI Workshop at University of Washington](http://nwb.org/events/workshop-2025-uwashington/), [NWB and DANDI Workshop at CoSyNe 2025](http://nwb.org/events/cosyne-2025/), [NWB and DANDI Workshop at UNAM](http://nwb.org/events/workshop-2025-unam/)

## Data Reuse Workshop Template

- **Learning objective:** Attendees will learn how to work with data on DANDI and will conduct a data reuse project to re-analyze existing data on NWB.

- **Estimated duration:** 5 days. The first day covers the core material about working with data on DANDI. The second day can focus on additional guest lectures to introduce attendees to different tools and datasets on DANDI. The remaining time can be spent on project hacking / analysis, with the workshop concluding in project presentations.

- **Prerequisites / requirements:** In previous workshops, we have required participants to propose a project with specific dandisets as part of their application. These projects can change throughout the course of the workshop.

- **Previous examples:** [NeuroDataReHack 2024](http://nwb.org/events/hck21-2024-janelia-ndrh/), [NeuroDataReHack 2023](http://nwb.org/events/hck16-2023-granada-rh/), [NeuroDataReHack 2022](http://nwb.org/events/hck14-2022-seattle-rh/)
