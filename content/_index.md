  heading: Neurodata Without Borders
  paragraph: <a href=''>Neurodata Without Borders</a> (NWB) is a data standard for
    neurophysiology, providing neuroscientists with a common standard to share,
    archive, use, and build analysis tools for neurophysiology data. NWB is
    designed to store a variety of neurophysiology data, including data from
    intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology experiments, data from
    optical physiology experiments, and tracking and stimulus data. <br><br> The
    <a href=''>NWB team</a> consists of neuroscientists and software developers
    who recognize that adoption of a unified data format is an important step
    toward breaking down the barriers to data sharing in neuroscience
