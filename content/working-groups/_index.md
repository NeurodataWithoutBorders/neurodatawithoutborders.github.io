title: Working Groups
banner_section:
  enable: true
  content: NWB is involved in several working groups to curate the core NWB
    standard, define ontologies, and integrate with other community standards
    and tools. Please contact us if you are interested in learning more or
    getting involved with one of these groups.
sections:
  - title: Genotype representation
    content: The aim of this working group is to define an NWB extension to enable
      scientists to systematically report the genotype of the transgenic animal
      used in their physiological experiments. Cell-type-specific recordings are
      often based on transgenic mice or rats. Accordingly mature infrastructure,
      such as public repositories and centralized databases, exist to support
      the scientific community in the use of these tools. We are extending the
      NWB standard to integrate and leverage these resources for storing
      relevant metadata on the genotypes and genetic backgrounds of individual
      mice, linking neurophysiological data to the databases and literature that
      characterize the experimental animals. <br><br>

  - title: Spatial coordinates representation
    content: Reporting of spatial coordinates within the brain is a complex problem,
      requiring registration between data collected with multiple recording
      modalities (imaging, probes) and across brain preparations (in vivo whole
      brain, slice) with common reference atlases and controlled vocabularies.
      The focus of this working group is to create an NWB extension to capture
      spatial coordinate systems, spatial mappings between two systems, and the
      representation of objects (e.g. cells, probes, injections, and optogenetic
      stimuli) within a spatial coordinate system. This type of standardization
      will facilitate the programmatic integration and comparison of data
      represented in NWB with other datasets that have been mapped to the same
      coordinate system. <br><br>

  - title: Behavioral task representation
    content: Behavioral tasks are an increasingly important component in
      neurophysiology experiments, and can have considerably more complex
      designs than passive sensory studies. There is currently no capability in
      NWB for storing the data and metadata that specify the control logic and
      behavioral contingencies that determine the flow of a behavioral session.
      The goal of this working group is to incorporate new features for
      improving descriptions of behavioral tasks within NWB. In this work, we
      are collaborating with the Kepecs lab at Washington University who are
      building a standard markup language (BEADL) to build state machine
      descriptions of task logic and control flow within a trial and across
      trials in a session, including tools for visualization, construction, and
      emulation of tasks from these machine-readable descriptions. <br><br>

  - title: External Working Groups
    bg_white: true
    content: NWB team members also participate in numerous external working groups.
      While the charge of external working groups are often broader than just
      NWB,  they all involve components that are relevant to NWB and commonly
      use NWB or are creating a Neurodata Extension (NDX) as part of their
      charge.
  - title: INCF Working Group on standardization of a directory structure containing
      neurophysiology data
    bg_white: true
    content: The objective of this project is to put together a set of
      specifications and tools that would allow the standardization of a
      directory structure containing experimental data recorded using animal
      models in neuroscience. The aim is to capitalize on the success of BIDS
      for human neuroimaging data, while retaining the specificities of datasets
      obtained in animal models. Such a standardized data structure will
      facilitate obtaining reproducible research and data sharing following the
      FAIR principles. In addition to data structures, the working group will
      discuss what experimental metadata is essential, and which formats and
      structures are appropriate for different metadata types. <br><br>

  - title: INCF Electrophysiology Stimulation Ontology Working Group
    bg_white: true
    content: Stimulus protocols are an essential component of neurophysiological
      experiments, and while the possibilities for stimulus protocols are
      endless, most studies still draw from a small set of commonly used
      protocols with stereotyped stimulus classes that allow standard analyses
      to be performed and results compared with other datasets. The aim of this
      working group is to define an extension for NWB that enables the storing
      of 1-dimensional stimulus waveform data and metadata with references to an
      ontology for standardization. This will facilitate comparing and
      identifying similar protocols across datasets and development of shared
      analysis scripts for quantitative feature extraction. For the first set of
      use cases, the group focused on intracellular electrophysiology, as most
      protocols use very similar protocols with waveforms that have stereotyped
      profiles (e.g., long steps, ramps, chirps). This working group will also
      draft recommendations for representation in NWB of parameterized stimuli
      beyond 1-D waveforms. <br><br>

  - title: Standardization of data/file formats for simulation outputs in
      computational neuroscience
    bg_white: true
    content: Both neuromorphic and HPC simulations can consume and generate data at
      very high rates. File formats and associated software libraries for such
      data need to be able to accommodate this requirement. In recent years a
      number of projects have been set up which address this (e.g. Brion,
      SONATA, SIONlib/NEST) , and the focus of this working group is to
      coordinate efforts between related projects to improve interoperability
      and make it easier to develop tools for visualization and analysis of such
      data. Tasks for this working group include compiling a list of existing
      formats, defining evaluation criteria and evaluating the different
      formats, and identifying avenues for improving interoperability. <br><br>

  sections:
    - title: Hierarchical structures for intracellular electrophysiology
      content: "Goal: In a neurophysiological experiment, individual recordings from a
        session are typically related by experimental design or condition, e.g.
        multiple time series that constitute a simultaneously recorded sweep or
        multiple recordings that result from repetitions of the same stimulus.
        The goal of this working group has been to define a structure for saving
        these data in the NWB format such that the structure of an experiment is
        clear and facilitates efficient browsing and retrieval of the data for
        users. Using intracellular electrophysiology as a first use case, the
        working group implemented a hierarchical table structure that
        facilitates grouping of data and metadata by experimental condition."

    title: Outcomes
    content: The working group drafted an extension for the NWB schema that
      implements these tables for testing and evaluation of the proposed changes
      (see <a href='https://github.com/oruebel/ndx-icephys-meta'>Source</a>,

      community review and has been merged with NWB after completion of the
      review. The new structures developed by this working group have been
