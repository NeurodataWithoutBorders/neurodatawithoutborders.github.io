We're excited to announce that the recorded talks from [**NeuroDataReHack 2025**](/events/hck24-2025-janelia-ndrh/) are now available on YouTube! This year's event, the 4th annual NeuroDataReHack, was a 5-day workshop hosted by Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, where participants learned to identify, access, and integrate open neurophysiology datasets into their research.

## Watch the Complete Playlist

The [NeuroDataReHack 2025 YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5wPNhoBP0ZDrMitdDwIsgV67xumuaP3G) contains 15 comprehensive talks covering the entire spectrum of working with open neuroscience data. These presentations provide invaluable insights for researchers looking to leverage the growing ecosystem of standardized neurophysiology datasets.

The complete slide materials are available in the resources below.

## About NeuroDataReHack

NeuroDataReHack events focus on generating new insights from existing neurophysiology data through secondary analysis. The workshop emphasizes analyzing data already in NWB format and available on DANDI, rather than converting new data. This approach enables researchers to:

- Validate findings across different species and brain areas
- Showcase analysis tools on established datasets  
- Explore follow-up questions to published studies
- Create educational content using open data

## Join the Community

These recordings serve as an excellent resource for anyone interested in:
- **Open neuroscience data** - Understanding standardized data formats and archives
- **Reproducible research** - Learning best practices for data sharing and reuse
- **Collaborative science** - Participating in the growing open neuroscience ecosystem
- **Tool development** - Building upon established frameworks and standards

Whether you're a PhD student, postdoctoral researcher, or principal investigator, these talks provide practical guidance for incorporating open data into your research workflow.

## Looking Ahead: NeuroDataReHack 2026

Interested in participating in a future NeuroDataReHack event? [**NeuroDataReHack 2026**](/events/hck26-2026-janelia-ndrh/) is already being planned for July 13-17, 2026, at Janelia Research Campus. This will be another opportunity to dive deep into open neurophysiology data analysis, learn from expert instructors, and collaborate with researchers from around the world. Stay tuned for more details and application information!
