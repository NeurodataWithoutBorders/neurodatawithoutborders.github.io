  content: Progress in modern science is enabled by data sharing. There are major
    obstacles, however, that limit the open exchange of data particularly in
    neuroscience, a field where many small laboratories are pursuing diverse
    questions about the brain using a greatvariety of tools and techniques. In
    mid 2014, The Kavli Foundation initiated Neurodata Without Borders, a
    consortium of researchers and foundations with a shared interest in breaking
    down the obstacles to data sharing.

  title: Overview
  content: The aim of Neurodata Without Borders is to standardize neuroscience
    data on an international scale. Our goal is to break down the geographic,
    institutional, technological and policy barriers that impede the flow of
    neuroscience data within the greater scientific community. Our intent is to
    accelerate the pace of discovery and success of brain research
    worldwide.<br><br> The need to standardize neuroscience data has never been
    more urgent. Large-scale brain research projects such as the U.S. BRAIN
    Initiative and resources such as the Allen Cell Types Database are producing
    massive quantities of data. But the full benefits of these data will not be
    realized if they cannot easily be shared, pooled and analyzed.

  content:
    - text: Unlike in other fields (i.e. genetics and cell biology), neuroscience does
        not have a standardized way to collect and share the wealth of existing
        data among researchers. The lack of a common format has made comparison
        across laboratories difficult and replication of specific experiments
        almost impossible, significantly slowing overall progress in the field.
    - text: Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) is a data standard for neurophysiology,
        providing neuroscientists with a common standard to share, archive, use,
        and build common analysis tools for neurophysiology data. NWB is
        designed to store a variety of neurophysiology data, including data from
        intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology experiments, data from
        optical physiology experiments, and tracking and stimulus data. The
        project includes not only the NWB format, but also a broad range of
        software for data standardization and application programming interfaces
        (APIs) for reading and writing the data as well as high-value datasets
        that have been translated into the NWB data standard.

    - text: Neurodata Without Borders is intended to serve the broad neuroscience
        community and encourage the sharing of data by scientists worldwide. NWB
        2.0 was released in February 2019. Please give it a try. Join our
        mailing list for updates or ask questions on our Slack channel.

  title: History
  content:
    - text: "Launched in mid 2014,  Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology began
        as a pilot project to produce a unified data format for cellular-based
        neurophysiology data. NWB 1.0 was based on representative use case
        studies from four laboratories, and the project included a vetting phase
        for assessing whether other data models can also be used in the new
        common format. The initial development of NWB 1.0 was funded by
        industry and private foundations. Scientific partners include the Allen
        Institute for Brain Science (AIBS), the Svoboda Lab (Janelia), the
        Meister Lab (Caltech), the Buzsáki Lab (NYU), and Fritz Sommer/Jeff
        Teeters (UCB, maintainers of CRCNS.org). This one-year pilot project
        resulted in NWB 1.0."
    - text: Building on the success of NWB 1.0, the project entered a second phase,
        with additional leadership by Dr. Kris Bouchard, Dr. Oliver Rübel
        (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, LBNL), Dr. Loren Frank (UCSF)
        and Dr. Edward Chang (UCSF). One main goal was to develop the next
        version of NWB and to enhance its adoption, through development of an
        advanced software architecture for NWB, a well-articulated data
        standards ecosystem, an open community software strategy, and
        advancements to the NWB data standard itself. NWB 2.0 was
        redeveloped by scientific software engineers/computer scientists at
        LBNL, Dr. Oliver Rübel and Mr. Andrew Tritt, in close collaboration with
        neuroscience laboratories and the broader NWB community. NWB 2.0 was
        released in February 2019 and new features continue to be added to the
        software ecosystem surrounding NWB 2.0.
    - text: The NWB project has also created a governance structure. An Executive
        Board (EB) decides the vision and roadmap for NWB and manages
        fundraising and outreach. The EB also works closely with a Technical
        Advisory Board (TAB), which makes technical decisions and maintains the
        software ecosystem.
    - text: We continue to see steady adoption of NWB:B by neuroscience labs,
        including the Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS), Bouchard lab
        (LBNL/UCB), Svoboda lab, Meister lab, Frank lab (UCSF), Chang lab (UCSF)
        and others. As labs adopt the format we also continue to see growing
        sets of data published in NWB. E.g, the AIBS has adopted the use of this
        format and to date has released numerous NWB files assaying mouse
        visual cortex.
