          - heading: "What is an NWBEP?"
            icon: /images/guidelines.png
            content: NWB Enhancement Proposals (NWBEP) are the official, formal way to propose major additions or changes to the NWB standard. They are used when a new feature, data type, or change is broadly useful to the community and should become part of the official NWB specification.
          - heading: "Review Process"
            icon: /images/p-process.png
            content: NWBEPs undergo a structured review and approval process facilitated by the NWB Technical Advisory Board (TAB) to ensure quality, consensus, and long-term maintainability.
          - heading: "Testing with Extensions"
            icon: /images/strategies.png
            content: NWBEPs often leverage NWB extensions (NDX) as a testing ground, implementing and evaluating proposed changes first as an NDX. This allows the community to use, test, and refine the extension in real-world scenarios before being considered for inclusion in the core NWB standard.

      - items:
          - heading: "Broad Community Benefit"
            icon: /images/nwb-tech.png
            content: Create an NWBEP when a new feature or data type would benefit the entire NWB community and should be standardized.
          - heading: "Core Type Changes"
            icon: /images/nwb-schema.png
            content: Use an NWBEP when changes to existing core types are needed or when standardization across the community is important for the proposed functionality.
          - heading: "Lab-Specific Needs"
            icon: /images/v-guidelines.png
            content: For lab-specific or experimental data types that don't need community-wide standardization, consider creating an NWB Extension (NDX) instead.
