## Description

ArControl is an Arduino based digital signals control system. It is particularly useful for establishing animal behavioral platforms (like Skinner boxes), controlling devices to deliver stimulation, and monitoring behavioral responses. ArControl is also effective for generating Optogenetic TTL pulses.

## Features

- Arduino-based digital signal control
- Behavioral platform control (e.g., Skinner box)
- Stimulation delivery control
- Behavioral response monitoring
- Optogenetic TTL pulse generation

## NWB Integration

While ArControl does not currently support recording data directly in NWB format, it provides tools for converting ArControl data to NWB:

- [NWB Conversion Tool](https://github.com/chenxinfeng4/ArControl-convert2-nwb)
- [Conversion Demo Notebook](https://github.com/chenxinfeng4/ArControl-convert2-nwb/blob/main/playground/demo_convert.ipynb)
