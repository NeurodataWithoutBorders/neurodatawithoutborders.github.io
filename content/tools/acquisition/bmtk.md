## Description

BMTK, SONATA, and Visual Neuronal Dynamics (VND) are mutually integrated software tools particularly suited to support large-scale bio-realistic brain modeling, but are applicable to a variety of neuronal modeling applications. BMTK is a suite for building and simulating network models at multiple levels of resolution, from biophysically-detailed, to point-neuron, to population-statistics approaches.

## Features

- Modular design for working across different scales of resolution
- Support for different simulation engines with the same code interface
- Integration with SONATA data format for:
  - Model architecture
  - Parameters
  - Simulation configuration
  - Input and output storage
- Visualization through VND's rendering capabilities

## NWB Integration

BMTK provides support for NWB through its spike stimulus functionality. For more information, see the [NWB Spike Stimulus documentation](https://alleninstitute.github.io/bmtk/ecephys_probe.html).
