## Description

EXTRACT (Tractable and Robust Automated Cell extraction Tool) is designed for calcium imaging analysis. It extracts the activities of cells as time series from both one-photon and two-photon Ca2+ imaging movies. EXTRACT makes minimal assumptions about the data, which is the main reason behind its high robustness and superior performance.
