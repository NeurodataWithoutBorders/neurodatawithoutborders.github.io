## Description

Neo is a Python package for working with electrophysiology data in Python, together with support for reading and writing a wide range of neurophysiology file formats. The goal of Neo is to improve interoperability between Python tools for analyzing, visualizing and generating electrophysiology data, by providing a common, shared object model.

In order to be as lightweight a dependency as possible, Neo is deliberately limited to representation of data, with no functions for data analysis or visualization.

## Features

- Common, shared object model for electrophysiology data
- Support for [many neurophysiology file formats](https://neo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rawiolist.html)
- Lightweight dependency focused on data representation
- Improves interoperability between Python tools
