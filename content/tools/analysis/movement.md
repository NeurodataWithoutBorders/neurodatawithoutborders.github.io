## Description

`movement` aims to provide a consistent, modular interface for analysing motion tracks, enabling steps such as data cleaning, visualisation, and motion quantification. `movement` aims to support all popular animal tracking frameworks and file formats.

## NWB Integration

`movement` pose datasets can be loaded from and saved to NWB files. The pose tracks are formatted according to the [ndx-pose](https://github.com/rly/ndx-pose) extension. See the NWB tab in the [movement I/O docs](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/user_guide/input_output.html).
