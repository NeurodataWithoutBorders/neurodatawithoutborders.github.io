## Description

AqNWB is a C++ API for acquiring neurophysiological data directly into the NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) format. Its goal is to provide a lightweight API to integrate with existing acquisition systems, enabling real-time streaming of data to NWB files during experiments.

AqNWB is designed to be embedded in data acquisition applications, allowing developers to write NWB-compliant files directly from their acquisition software without post-hoc conversion.

## Installation

See the [AqNWB Documentation](https://nwb.org/aqnwb) for detailed installation and integration instructions:

* [User Installation](https://nwb.org/aqnwb/user_install_page)
* [Developer Installation](https://nwb.org/aqnwb/dev_install_page)


## Additional Information

AqNWB is under active development. The core functionality for writing and reading NWB files is fully functional. AqNWB does not yet support writing of all neurodata_types defined in NWB.
