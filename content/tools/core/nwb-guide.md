## Description

NWB GUIDE (Graphical User Interface for Data Entry) is a desktop application that provides a no-code interface for converting neurophysiology data to NWB using NeuroConv. It makes the process of data conversion accessible to researchers who may not have programming experience.

NWB GUIDE allows users to:
- Select data files for conversion
- Configure metadata for NWB files
- Convert data to NWB format through an intuitive user interface
- Validate the resulting NWB files

**Note:** NWB GUIDE is in pre-release status and under active development.

## Installation

```bash
# Installation instructions will be provided once the tool is released
# Currently, users can access the development version by cloning the repository
git clone https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb-guide.git
```

## Usage

The NWB GUIDE provides a step-by-step workflow for converting data to NWB:

1. Select the source data format
2. Select data files
3. Enter metadata information
4. Configure conversion settings
5. Run the conversion
6. Validate the output NWB file

## Additional Information

The NWB GUIDE leverages NeuroConv behind the scenes, making it easier for researchers to adopt the NWB standard without writing code. It provides a user-friendly alternative for data conversion while maintaining the robustness and flexibility of the underlying conversion tools.
