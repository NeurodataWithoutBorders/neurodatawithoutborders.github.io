## Description

The Neurodata Extensions Catalog (NDX Catalog) is a community-led catalog of Neurodata Extensions (NDX) to the NWB data standard. The NDX Catalog provides a central portal to search, publish, and review NDX extensions.

Neurodata Extensions (NDX) are used to extend the NWB data standard, for example, to integrate new data types with NWB or define standards for lab- or project-specific metadata.

## Usage

The NDX Catalog is a web-based resource that can be accessed at [nwb-extensions.github.io](https://nwb-extensions.github.io). The NDX Catalog allows users to:

- Browse available extensions by category
- Search for extensions based on keywords
- Access extension documentation
- Find installation instructions for specific extensions
- Submit new extensions for inclusion in the catalog

To use a specific extension from the catalog, follow the installation instructions provided on the extension's page.

## Publishing your Extension on the NDX Catalog

See the [publishing extensions](https://nwb-overview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions_tutorial/7_publishing_extensions.html#publishing-extensions) tutorial for details on how to publish an extension on the catalog. 

## Additional Information

The NDX Catalog is an important resource for the NWB community, facilitating the discovery and adoption of extensions that enhance the capabilities of the NWB standard for specific use cases and data types.
