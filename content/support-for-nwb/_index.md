  points:
    - "NWB is a language to harmoniously describe neurophysiology data and is the connective tissue that enables a vibrant digital ecosystem. This ecosystem enables meaningful sharing of neurophysiology data across the neuroscience community and beyond."
    - "The impact of NWB has been profound, and we are at an inflection point of exponential growth in openly available data in NWB. NWB is foundational digital infrastructure for several ongoing large-scale, coordinated neuroscience research activities (e.g., NIH BBQS program and DANDI/EMBER archives, Allen Institute for Brain Science and International Brain Laboratory). "
    - "NWB enables re-use and aggregation of complex neurophysiology data, which has resulted in over 150 publications that utilize previously collected data stored in NWB â€“ this is new knowledge from existing data, truly maximizing return-on-investment (ROI) in neuroscience experiments. By enabling re-use and aggregation of neurophysiology data, the NWB ecosystem is required to realize the full potential of AI across the  neuroscience community."
    - "The funding for NWB will disappear completely beginning in March 2026, resulting in the dissolution of the team. The dissolution of the team would both bring an abrupt and complete end to work and support of NWB. This would additionally have a chilling effect on the selection of scientific software engineering in neuroscience as a viable career path in the future."
