    - title: Advancing Standardization of Neurophysiology Data Through Dissemination
        of NWB
      content: The National Institute of Health, through project 5U24NS120057, funded
        Oliver Rübel (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) and Benjamin
        Dichter (CatalystNeuro) to disseminate Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)
        neurophysiology technologies developed as part of the NIH BRAIN
        Initiative broadly to the neuroscience research community. To lower the
        barrier of adopting NWB, the project focuses on the needs of 1)
        neuroscience researchers and laboratories by enhancing user training,
        support, and coverage of new technologies and 2) neuroscience tools and
        technologies by maintaining core NWB technologies and integrating with a
        wide array of powerful data tools and technologies.
