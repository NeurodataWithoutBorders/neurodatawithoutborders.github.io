              which users, developers, issues, and tools are selected for
              support for NWB training and integration as part of the NIH
              project “Advancing Standardization of Neurophysiology Data Through
              Dissemination of NWB” 


              [DataJoint / NWB Roadmap (external)](/):  **DataJoint** and **NWB** are two neuroinformatics initiatives in active development. The projects develop independently yet they have complementary aims and overlapping user communities. This document establishes key processes for coordinating development and communications in order to promote integration and interoperability across the two ecosystems.
