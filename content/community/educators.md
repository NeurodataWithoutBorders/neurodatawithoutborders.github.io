  title: "Teaching Neuroscience with Real Data"
  intro_md: |
    Use real NWB datasets and ready-to-run notebooks to teach neuroscience concepts. If you're interested in using NWB datasets to teach neuroscience concepts:

    1. **Explore Available Datasets**: Identify datasets appropriate for your course level and topics.
    2. **Use Educational Resources**: Leverage ready-to-use notebooks and guides, e.g., NWB4EDU and the OpenScope Databook.
    3. **Start Small**: Begin with a single lab or homework assignment using pre-existing analysis notebooks.
    4. **Share Your Experience**: Contribute your teaching materials back to the community to help other educators.

  title: "Teaching  FAIR Data and Software Practices"
  intro_md: |
    Use NWB to teach FAIR principles, data standardization, and software best practices. If you're interested in teaching open science, data management, and software best practices:

    1. **Use NWB as a Case Study**: Demonstrate FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) using a well-defined standard.
    2. **Teach Data Standardization**: Show students how standardized formats enable data sharing and reuse across laboratories.
    3. **Explore the Open-Source Ecosystem**: Practice version control, documentation, and collaboration with community-maintained tools.
    4. **Review Training Materials**: Draw from curated workshop resources and examples.
    5. **Join the Community**: Connect with other educators through events and working groups.

Open data and standardized formats like NWB are valuable resources for transforming neuroscience education by providing students with access to real, high-quality datasets from leading research laboratories. The NWB format offers several key advantages for educational settings:

- **Teach with Real Data**: Give students hands-on experience with actual experimental data from leading laboratories rather than simulated datasets
- **Standardized Structure**: Students learn a consistent data format with rich metadata that they'll encounter in research settings
- **Multi-Modal Data**: Access datasets combining electrophysiology, imaging, behavior, and other modalities in a single format
- **Software Ecosystem**: Extensive tools and libraries for reading, writing, and analyzing NWB data in Python and MATLAB
- **Promote Reproducibility**: Teach best practices in data management, documentation, and reproducible research from the start
- **Community Support**: Active community providing documentation, tutorials, and support for educators and learners

The NWB team is committed to supporting educators. If you have questions about using NWB in your teaching or would like to discuss educational initiatives, please [contact us](/contact-us/).
