## What are NWB events?

The [Neurodata Without Borders](https://www.nwb.org/) (NWB) events are hands-on gatherings lasting several days in which neurophysiology researchers create solutions using the open source NWB software packages.

Participants work collaboratively on solutions that use the NWB unified data format for cellular-based neurophysiology data, which is focused on the dynamics of groups of neurons measured under a large range of experimental conditions. In contrast to conferences and workshops where the primary focus is to report results, the objective of these events is to provide a venue for creators and users of neurophysiology open-source software to collaboratively work on related research projects.

## Types of NWB Events

Over the course of the NWB endeavor, the NWB team has created a range of different event types to address different needs:

- **NeurodataReHack**: Focused on training and projects to generate new insights from existing neurophysiology data through secondary analysis.
- **User Days**: Focused on training and engagement with the NWB user community and integration of data and lab processes with NWB.
- **Developer Days**: Focused on engagement with the broader developer community and on integration and development of NWB-enabled tools and core software.
- **Docathon**: Focused on enhancing documentation for NWB and associated software.
- **NWB Core Hackathons**: These hackathons focus on development of the core NWB data standard and software. This includes in particular the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd hackathon.
- **Workshops and Tutorials**: Focused on introducing NWB to new users and providing hands-on training in specific contexts, such as at conferences or institutions.

## History of NWB Events

The NWB team consists of neuroscientists and software developers who recognize that creation and adoption of a unified data format is an important step toward breaking down the barriers to data sharing in neuroscience. Hackathons and other events are a way for us to collaborate and develop NWB as well as to engage with the NWB user community.

### NWB 1.x (2014-2017)
The NWB initiative began with the development of NWB 1.x, during which two hackathons were held at Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Virginia:
- The first hackathon on November 20â€“22, 2014
- The second hackathon on May 14-16, 2015

### NWB 2.0 and Beyond (2017-Present)
As part of the development of NWB 2.0, a third hackathon was held at Janelia Research Campus on July 31 - August 1, 2017. The primary focus of the first three hackathons was on development of the NWB format as well as on development of a software strategy for NWB.

To encourage the development, growth and use of NWB as a unified data format for cellular-based neurophysiology data, the Allen Institute for Brain Science, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and Kitware organized a development-focused hackathon at the Allen Institute for Brain Science (April 3-6, 2018) and a user-engagement and training hackathon at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (April 25-27, 2018).

Since then, the NWB team has continued to organize various types of events to support the growing NWB community, including:

- Regular User Days and Developer Days events
- Docathons to improve documentation
- NeurodataReHack events focused on data reuse
- Conference tutorials and workshops
- Virtual events during the COVID-19 pandemic

As of 2025, the NWB ecosystem has grown significantly, with over 300 datasets on the DANDI Archive in NWB format, including data from the Allen Institute, the International Brain Laboratory, and many individual labs. The hackathons and other events continue to play a crucial role in the development and adoption of NWB as a standard for neurophysiology data.
