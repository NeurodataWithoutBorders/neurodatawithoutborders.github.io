# NWB Design System Implementation Status

## Phase 1 Progress (Foundation)

We've begun implementing the design system foundation as outlined in the implementation plan. Here's what has been accomplished and what remains for Phase 1:

### Completed

1. **Design System Foundation**
   - ✅ Created `design-system.css` with color variables, typography, spacing, and utility classes
   - ✅ Created `components.css` with styled components (buttons, cards, alerts, navigation)
   - ✅ Added JS functionality in `design-system.js` for interactive components
   - ✅ Updated the header template with dark blue background and frosted glass effect
   - ✅ Styled the footer with a dark theme matching the header with spotted texture background
   - ✅ Added bottom-aligned buttons for tool cards while preserving original design
   - ✅ Added external link icons to navigation elements for better user experience
   - ✅ Fixed bullet formatting and link appearance in Grants and Projects page
   - ✅ Aligned image dimensions on News cards to match the News page template
   - ✅ Standardized news card heights for consistent appearance

2. **Documentation & Examples**
   - ✅ Created example templates for components:
     - Modern card examples
     - Modern button examples
     - Analysis tools cards with bottom-aligned buttons
  
3. **Integration**
   - ✅ Added CSS and JS files to the site via head.html and script-footer.html partials

### Next Steps for Phase 1

1. **Apply Component Styles to Existing Elements**
   - [ ] Update homepage sections to use new card styles
   - [ ] Update buttons site-wide to use new button styles
   - [ ] Apply proper spacing classes to improve layout

2. **Layout Improvements**
   - [ ] Increase white space between sections
   - [ ] Update container widths and padding
   - [ ] Improve mobile navigation experience

3. **Testing & Refinement**
   - [ ] Test on various screen sizes and browsers
   - [ ] Refine responsive breakpoints
   - [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance

## Implementation Instructions

To continue implementation, follow these steps:

1. **Update Homepage Components**
   - Apply the new card classes to feature sections
   - Update CTA buttons with modern button classes
   - Adjust spacing using the new utility classes

2. **Update Other Page Templates**
   - Apply new component styles to events pages
   - Apply new component styles to news pages
   - Update the footer with modern styling

3. **Mobile Experience**
   - Test and refine mobile navigation
   - Ensure proper spacing on mobile devices
   - Verify touch targets are appropriately sized

## Usage Guide

The design system consists of:

- **Variables and Utilities**: `design-system.css`
- **Component Styles**: `components.css`
- **Interactive Functionality**: `design-system.js`

These files are included in the site's head and footer sections and provide all necessary styling and functionality.

### Class Naming Conventions

- Use utility classes for spacing: `mb-lg`, `py-xl`, etc.
- Use component classes for UI elements: `card`, `btn-primary`, etc.
- Typography classes follow a clear pattern: `text-lg`, `font-medium`, etc.

### Further Documentation

For component examples, refer to:
- `/templates/modern-card-examples.html`
- `/templates/modern-button-examples.html`

These files contain working examples of the components with usage notes.

## Phase 2 Preview

Once Phase 1 is complete, Phase 2 will focus on:

1. Redesigning the hero section
2. Updating feature sections
3. Modernizing the news section
4. Implementing a statistics component
5. Adding testimonial components

The groundwork laid in Phase 1 will make these improvements straightforward to implement.
